# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
An employee of the Colorado Board of Elections provided us with a series tasks in order to conduct an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The tasks were as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Compile a list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Election Audit Summary
As the results have shown, this script was utilized to analyze and audit voting data for three counties, pertaining to: how many votes in total, per candidate, and per county. With some modifications, the script can be applied to essentially any election. The framework for the script has been set, thus, allowing room for expansion and customization per the userâ€™s preference. In one example, this code could be expanded upon to audit voting data for a national-level election such as the presidential election. Votes could be calculated for each state for a broader overview of what percentage of voters in each state voted for which candidate. Another use for the script could also be at the state-level for the senate. The user could modify the script to look into voter data for what number of votes in each county, went to which senator running for the senate. As we can see, there are a multitude of uses for this script.
